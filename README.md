# Movie Info Finder App

This app allows the user to search up any movie and find details about it such as the ratings, the plot, year made, writers, actors, and box
office numbers. In addition to searching, this app has predownloaded movies of different genres to look through on the homepage. You can tap on
the different movies to be directed to an overview page for the movie.
